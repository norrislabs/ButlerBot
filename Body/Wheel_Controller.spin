'' Wheel_Controller.spin
''
'' This file provides the code for a Wheel Control object which is designed to
'' provide a user friendly interface to a Parallax Inc. Motor Mount and Wheel
'' Kit (#27971) with Position Controllers (#29319).  The Position Controllers
'' are connected to a pair of Parallax HB-25 Motor Controllers (#29144).
'' Although it is not necessary for the user of this Wheel Controller object
'' to understand how the interface actually works, it is recommended that they
'' obtain the appropriate documentation from Parallax Inc. and acquire a basic
'' understanding of how everything works.
''
'' The provided public methods allow the user to command the wheel kit to go
'' a specified distance in inches, set the speed in feet per minute and perform
'' stationary turns in degrees.  Methods are also provided for biasing the
'' wheel speeds to produce moving turns or arcs.  The user may request at any
'' time the current wheel positions and speeds.
''
'' A status is provided so that the user may determine if the Wheel Controller
'' has failed.  In such a case the user may reset the Wheel Controller Cog.
'' All communications with the Position Controllers is via a dedicated Cog
'' running an assembly language routine. 
''
'' There is a set of constants which the user may use to customize the Wheel
'' Controller object.  However, probably the only one you will need to modify
'' is the wheel base (see WHEEL_BASE).  All other constants have been optimized
'' during bench tests.
''
'' In Version 1.1 a Joy Stick method was added for those users that wish to
'' control the wheels in a remote control fashion.  No other method needs to be
'' used.  See the comments for the JoyStick method.  This function has been
'' bench tested.  It has not actually been tested with a remote control device.
'' I would like to know if anyone is successful with a remote device.  I am
'' willing to fix any problems that may occur.  Note that this object was
'' originally designed for autonomous control.

'' Joy Stick Method
''
'' This method should be used when total remote control is desired.  The user
'' may use joy stick type inputs to control the wheels.  The 'X' value would be
'' for setting the speed and the 'Y' value for turning.  A positive value for
'' 'X' would be a forward speed, a negative value for reverse speed and zero
'' for stop.  When moving forward, a positive value for 'Y' would cause a right
'' turn, a negative value a left turn and zero would be for straight travel.
'' In reverse the turning action would be as expected. Think of it as behaving
'' like a steering wheel.
''
'' The speed and the turn bias parameters cannot go from negative to positive
'' without first going through zero.  If the user attempts to do so then this
'' method will force a zero value and the user must make another call with the
'' desired values.
''
'' Caution should be taken when going from a high speed to a low speed. For
'' example if the speed is changed from 100% to 5%, the wheels will stop
'' instantly.  This will be abrupt and undesirable.  Decreasing the speed
'' should be done in small steps.  Going from a high speed to zero speed is
'' not a problem.
''
'' The Joy Stick function uses the Auto-Travel mode to keep the wheels
'' moving.  The user never has to perform a travel command.  As a result, the
'' user can control the wheels with just this method.  No other methods need
'' to be used other than the Open and Start methods.
''
'' This method will block if there is an active set speed command.  It will
'' also block if called when the wheels are being stopped.
